/*!
 * \brief Draws a bunch of triangles and outputs each frame to an image.
 * \details
 * - Declare and initialize variables to keep track of each of three vertices for a triangle.
 * - Set the Canvas to record screenshots for 30 seconds (1800 frames).
 * - Set up the internal timer of the Canvas to expire every \b FRAME seconds.
 * - While the Canvas is open:
 *   - Sleep the internal timer until the Canvas is ready to draw.
 *   - Set the old coordinates to last frame's middle ones.
 *   - Set the middle coordinates to last frame's new ones.
 *   - Set the new coordinates to a random position on the Canvas.
 *   - Draw a triangle on the canvas with the given coordinates and a random color.
 *   .
 * .
 * \note The details of the recordForNumFrames() function are handled automatically in Canvas, and
 * are by default written to the i frames/ directory.
 * \param can Reference to the Canvas being drawn to.
